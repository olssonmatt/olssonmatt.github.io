            <h2>summary</h2>
                <p>A project completed by another student and I to fulfill a courses requirements. The project entailed us creating a Python script to generate the Fibonacci sequence. A few other scripts were then written to apply mathematical operators to the set of numbers return the results that we sought out. The relations to Binet's forumla were also studied and observed.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>abstract</h2>
            <p>An overview of the Fibonacci sequence and its relation to the Golden Ratio will be observed, as well as taking a look at the sequences produced by <i>F<sub>n</sub></i> modulo <i>m</i>, or the Pisano Period. In the first section, series of numbers were created where the next term is given by the sum of the previous two terms – starting at 0 and 1. Furthermore, it will be seen that dividing the current Fibonacci number by the previous one (for up to <i>n</i> = 25 to be tested) will display an approach to Golden Ratio (denoted by φ). A general solution that will carry out the purpose of finding the <i>n<sup>th</sup></i> Fibonacci number will be shown to have a relation to the Golden Ratio. This is called Binet’s Formula. In the second part, the modulo of the Fibonacci numbers is taken to form a sequence, where periodic cycles within it can be seen. These are titled the Pisano Periods. Looking at the resulting sequences, an increasing <i>m</i> for <i>F<sub>n</sub></i> modulo <i>m</i>, will demonstrate sub sequences and of these results are Fibonacci numbers.  We determine all these results by using Python and analyzing the characteristic behaviour of our resulting sequences.</p>
