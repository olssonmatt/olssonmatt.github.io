                <h2>11/08/2021</h2>
                <p>Adding some notes to the notes pages. Completed the machine learning for python lecture, as well as the gravitional waves lecture. Tomorrow will entail my first steps into understanding and mapping out the project.</p><br>
                <br>
                <h2>10/08/2021</h2>
                <p>Small updates, adding notes page(s), blog post, and fixed inconsistencies. Starting my journey into the <i>G2Net Gravitational Wave Detection</i> contest. Will start today by summarizing machine learing, and gravitational wave lectures. </p>

                <h2>30/07/2021</h2>
                <p>Added a music page to my website to display some of the works I've done. Made changes to my resume, CV, cover letter after meeting with an HR rep. The job search treads onward. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>19/07/2021</h2>
                <p>Made vast improvements and changes to the website. Uploaded some projects to my Github repository. </p>

                <h2>08/06/2021</h2>
                <p>Since the last post I have been keeping up my applications to jobs and administrative works. Had some time to do other moving work with life (graduation, moving, etc.). Today I have begun some freelance data work for a small hobby company. I am also retaking the <i>SQL for Data Science</i> course on Coursera. This will hopefully add as a refresher and allow my to create and manipulate my own data. A python course will be next to tackle and include in my projects.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>07/06/2021</h2>
                <p>Trying to start my physical habits again and went on a short run. I will complete an accelerated version of the <i>C25K</i> to back myself back into form. Also began some reading to make those good habits and sharpen up those skills. The book I am starting with is <i>"A Beautiful Mind"</i> by Sylvia Nasar. I have not seen the movie so expect to garner a lot of knowledge about John Nash and his journey through this. </p>

                <h2>01/06/2021</h2>
                <p>Worked on some music with a friend to hopefully make a project out of it. </p>
                <br>
                <br>  
                <h2>31/05/2021</h2>
                <p>Administrative work for applying to jobs. Included some more information in the projects tabs. Prepping old data from the Brock Esports season to apply it to the SITT model. I will try and write a web fetching script that allows me to grab data from HLTV. This will be done to attain a model player to compare statistics to. </p>

                <br>
                <h2>27/05/2021</h2>
                <p>Further improvements to the website being made. Added multiple tabs and created some low level graphics for the header, footer, body, etc. Got the bulk of the websites content all formatted and in place.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>26/05/2021</h2>
                <p>Began learning HTML by working through a template to create this website. It will be hosted on GitHub. This was done to get used to doing Git pulls and requests as well as being a nice free option. Once it is done, I plan on making it public and getting started with some data science projects.</p>
