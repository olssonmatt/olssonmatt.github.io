    " - Key Descriptors\n",
    "     - Canada, with its large landmass and diversified geography, has substantial renewable resources that can be used to produce energy; these resources include moving water, wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, and ocean energy.\n",
    "    - Canada is a world leader in renewable resources. Renewable energy sources currently provide about 18.9 per cent of Canada’s total primary energy supply.\n",
    "    - Moving water is the most important renewable energy source in Canada, providing 59.3 per cent of Canada’s electricity generation\n",
    "    - Wind is the second most important renewable energy source in Canada. It accounts for 3.5 per cent of electricity generation in Canada.\n",
    "    - Biomass is the third largest renewable source of Canada’s electricity generation. Its share in Canada’s electricity generation is 1.4 per cent.\n",
    "    - ***Wind and solar photovoltaic energy are the fastest growing sources of electricity in Canada.***\n",
    " - What is renewable energy?\n",
    "     - It is energy that is derived from natural processes that are replenished at a rate that is equal to or faster than the rate at which they are consumer\n",
