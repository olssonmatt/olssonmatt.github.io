    "### types\n",
    " - int\n",
    "     - a type int is an integer number (1,2,0,-1)\n",
    " - float\n",
    "     - a type float is a decimal number (1.2, 3.45, 0.0)\n",
    " - string\n",
    "     - a string is a sequence of characters\n",
    " - type() function\n",
    "     - the type() function will return what data type the entry is \n",
    "     - `type(1):int`, `type(1.0):float`, `type('1'):str`\n",
    " - type casting function\n",
    "     - changes the type of one data type to another data type \n",
    "     - `float(2):2.0`, `int(2.1):2`, `int(2.9):2`, `int('2'):2`, `int('A'):err`, `str(2):'2'`\n",
    " - boolean\n",
    "     - boolean values can only take on two values; True and False\n",
    "     - type(True):bool\n",
    "     - `float(True):1`, `int(True):1`\n",
    "     - `float(Flase):0`, `int(False):0`\n",
    "    \n",
    "### expressions and variables\n",
    " - expressions\n",
    "     - expressions are operations python performs\n",
    "     - an expression contains operands (numbers or variables) and operators (+, -, /, etc.)\n",
    "     - in python 3 division of integers returns a float (// for int division)\n",
    "     - python follows math convetions when performing expressions (BEDMAS)\n",
    " - variables\n",
    "     - variables store values and is done so by using the equal sign, `x=10` or `my_variables=1`\n",
    "     - variables take the last value reference in the code, `x=1\\n x=1\\n x:1`\n",
    "     - variables can store expressions, `y=x/10`\n",
    "     - variables can overwrite themselves, `x=2\\n x=x/2\\n x:1`\n",
    "\n",
    "### string operations\n",
    " - a string is a sequence of characters\n",
    " - a string is contained within double (\"\") or single ('') quotes \n",
    " - strings can be assigned to variables\n",
    " - helpful thought is to think of strings as order sequences\n",
    "     - `x = \"M y  n a m e  M a t t\"`\n",
    "     - `x = \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\"`\n",
    " - each element in a string can be accessed with an index by this thought, `x[10]:t` \n",
    " - string operations\n",
    "     - slicing a string can be done to get a subset of the string, `x[1:5]:y na`\n",
    "     - stride on a string is gather every nth number of a string, `x[::2]:M aeat`\n",
    "     - together you can return every nth value of a subset. `x[0:5:2]:M a`\n",
    "     - length command returns the length of a string, `len(x):12`\n",
    "     - concatenating a string can be done by addition `x + ' beans':My name Matt beans`\n",
    "     - replacating a string can by done by multiplying the string `2*x:My name MattMy name Matt`\n",
    " - strings are immutable (cannot edit existing values), `x[0] neq M`\n",
    " - however you can change the string by setting it to the original value, `x = x + ' beans' \\n x:My name Matt beans`\n",
    " - escape sequences\n",
    "     - \"\\\" represent escape sequences, or strings too difficult to input\n",
    "     - \\n in a string forces a new line, `print('My \\n name Matt'):My\n",
    "     name Matt`)\n",
    "     - \\t represents a tab\n",
    "     - to place a backslash in the string either place an r in front of the string (`print(r'My name \\ Matt')`) or use a double backslash (`print('My name \\\\ Matt')`\n",
    " - sequences methods apply methods that work on lists or tuples\n",
    " - string methods have a second set of methods that just work on strings\n",
    "     - they take some string, *A*, and output a new string, *B*, from that operation\n",
    "     - the upper() method returns the string in all uppercase, `x.upper():MY NAME MATT'`\n",
    "     - the replace() method returns the string with some subset of the string replaced by some new input, `x.replace('Matt', 'hotdog'):My name hotdog`\n",
    "     - the find() method returns the index number of where that string can be found, `x.find('Ma'):8`\n",

    "### lists and tuples\n",
    " - tuples\n",
    "     - an ordered sequence\n",
    "     - are written as comma-separated elements within parentheses\n",
    "     - Ex. `tuple = (10,9,6,5,10,8,9,6,2)`\n",
    "     - all types can be contained in a tuple (string, float, and integer can be in a tuple)\n",
    "     - each element can be accessed via an index \n",
    "     - Ex. `tuple[2]=6`\n",
    "     - tuples can be negatively indexed\n",
    "     - tuples can be concatenated\n",
    "     - tuples can be sliced\n",
    "     - tuples are immutable\n",
    "     - tuples can contain tuples (nesting)\n",
    "         - Ex. `tuple = (1,2,(\"pop\",\"rock\"),(3,4),(\"disco\",(1,2)))`\n",
    "         - Ex. `tuple[2]:[1]=\"rock\"`\n",
    "         - helpful to think of nested tuples as trees\n",
    " - lists\n",
    "     - list are also ordered sequences\n",
    "     - a list is represented with square brackets\n",
    "     - Ex. `list = [3,4,6,6.7,\"yo\"]`\n",
    "     - a key difference between a list and a tuple is that lists are mutable\n",
    "     - tuples can be nested within lists\n",
    "     - extend\n",
    "         - the method extend concatenates two lists together with unique index'\n",
    "         - `list.extend([4,5])` then `list = [3,4,6,6.7,\"yo\",4,5]`\n",
    "     - append\n",
    "         - the method append adds the list as a single entry\n",
    "         - `list.append([4,5])` then `list = [3,4,6,6.7,\"yo\",[4,5]]`\n",
    "     - replacing an element\n",
    "         - `list[0] = \"beans\"` then `list = [\"beans\",4,6,6.7,\"yo\"]`\n",
    "     - removing an element\n",
    "         - `del(list[0])` then `list = [4,6,6.7,\"yo\"]`\n",
    "     - can convert strings to a list\n",
    "         - split can make elements into lists by taking the strings spaced by a space into elements\n",
    "         - `\"well rested\".split() = [\"well\",\"rested\"]`\n",
    "         - however the split function can be used to split strings on a character (delimiter)\n",
    "         - `\"A,C,B,D\".split(\",\")=[\"A\",\"C\",\"B\",\"D\"]`\n",
    "         \n",
    "### dictionaries\n",
    " - dictionaries are a type of collection in python\n",
    " - recall lists, integer indexes with elements assigned to an index\n",
    " - a dictionary has keys and values (key analog to integer and element to value)\n",
    " - keys do not have integers and are usually characters\n",
    " - dictionaries are denoted by curly brackets\n",
    " - the keys have to be immutable and unique\n",
    " - the values can be immutabe, mutable, and duplicates\n",
    " - each key and values pair is separated by a comma\n",
    "     - Ex. `dict = {\"key1\":1,\"key2\":\"2\",\"key3\":[3,3,3],\"key4\":(4,4,4),('key5'):5}`\n",
    " - reference dictionary entries as such\n",
    "     -  `dict[\"key1\"] = 1, dict[\"key3\"] = [3,3,3]`\n",
    " - add dictionary entries as such\n",
    "     - `dict[\"key6\"] = \"ford raptor\"`\n",
    "     - `dict = {\"key1\":1,\"key2\":\"2\",\"key3\":[3,3,3],\"key4\":(4,4,4),('key5'):5,\"key6\":\"ford raptor\"}`\n",
    " - delete dictionary entries as such\n",

    "     - `dict = {\"key1\":1,\"key2\":\"2\",\"key3\":[3,3,3],('key5'):5,\"key6\":\"ford raptor\"}`\n",
    " - search the dictionary as such\n",
    "     - `\"key6\" in dict` then *True*\n",
    "     - `\"key4\" in dict` then *False*\n",
    " - to isolate keys and values use the following methods\n",
    "     - `dict.keys() = {\"key1\",\"key2\",\"key3\",('key5'),\"key6\"}`\n",
    "     - `dict.values() = {1,\"2\",[3,3,3],5,\"ford raptor\"}`\n",
    "      \n",
    "### sets\n",
    " - sets are a type of collection \n",
    " - sets are unordered (no record of element position)\n",
    " - sets have only unique elements\n",
    "     - only one of a particular element in a set\n",
    " - sets are denoted by curly brackets\n",
    "     - Ex. `set = {\"golf\",\"ball\",\"swing\",\"stick\",\"ball\"} = {\"golf\",\"ball\",\"swing\",\"stick\"}`\n",
    " - a list can be converted into a set by the set function (called type casting)\n",
    "     - Ex. `list = [3,4,6,3,\"yo\",6.7,\"yo\"]` then `set(list) = {3,4,6,6.7,\"yo\"}`\n",
    " - add elements to a set as such\n",
    "     - `set.add(\"flag\")` then `set = {\"golf\",\"ball\",\"swing\",\"stick\",\"flag\"}`\n",
    "     - adding the same item twice will not be effective since there are no duplicates in sets\n",
    " - remove elements from a set as such\n",
    "     - `set.remove(\"swing\")` then `set = {\"golf\",\"ball\",\"stick\",\"flag\"}`\n",
