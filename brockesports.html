                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>I had started a data science division within the Brock Esports club. This division entailed of a team of 7 data analysts carry out various task to aid the competitive teams on their paths. I managed and dealt with the assigning of the data analysts to each team. I also aided to provide as much insight into the world as much as I could to the team. The teams we provided analytics to were CS:GO, Valorant, Rocket League, Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Hearthstone. The two main teams that pertained to myself were the CS:GO and Overwatch teams.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>CS:GO</h3>
                    <p>My work with the CS:GO team consisted mainly of two parts. One part handled the 'pre-game stats' and one part that handled the post game stats. The pre-game stats would give the players information on the teams that they were playing. This ranged from map selection and results to the overall strength of each player. The post game stats dealt with the general oversight of the players performance. Due to time restraints, individual demos could not be analyzed in great detail but the oversights allowed for generalization of the players performance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Overwatch</h3>
                    <p>My assistance with the Overwatch team was short but the new style of game allowed me to seeing new and different aspects of statistics that could be used. One exciting application was the use of frequency tables in relation to 'hero' selections. This would allow for the optimized selection of heros when entering into a game as it would correlate with win rate. </p>
