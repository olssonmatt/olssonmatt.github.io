            <h1>career objective</h1>
            <p>My career objective is to gain a wide variety of knowledge and to be able to cross reference over the large subject gap. I also wish to satisfy any curiosities in each topic by way of research. The areas in physics that I enjoy are medical applications, nuclear, and theoretical physics. My mathematical interests arise from mathematical physics, cryptography, and data analytics. Being at the forefront of the research and development in these topics is of great interest to me.</p>

            <p>Besides academia, I am interested in the practical applications of these areas in multiple industries. The utilization of data analytics in commerce, and eSports are industries that I see value and have curiosity in. I also have interest in the strides for fusion power, optimized medical physics equipment, and the use of data and cryptography for defense. Apart from the STEM fields my interests also include music, music production, and economics.</p>
