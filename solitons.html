            <h2>summary</h2>
                <p>Wrote a literary review and prepared a presentation for the class on Yoritaka Iwatas 2004 paper 'Solitons in nuclear time-dependent density functional theory'. The paper dealt with the application of soliton equations (namely 2-soliton KdV equation) to many-nucleon bodies. This was done to achieve a predictable and suitable model for these systems.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>example</h2>
                <p>A small portion of the paper was taken out to display some of the work I did.</p>
                <br>
                <p> "<font size=2>The focus next is on the the nonlinear dispersive waves. In the interest of length, only the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations will be discussed. To begin, the properties that make a soliton are re-introduced. Since however, the paper deals with the idea that there many-nulceon systems (many solitons) they will be tweaked to include the idea of interactions at its core. Solitons satisfy the properties that: the wave moves at constant velocity and maintains its momentum and shape after collisions, and the wave could experiences a shift in phase and time delay during the collisions. The equation that has the information about the soliton solution is contained in the KdV equation. The equation follows as such:</font></p>
                <p><font size=2>∂<sub>t</sub>u + αu∂<sub>x</sub>u + ∂<sup>3</sup><sub>x</sub>u = 0</font></p>
                <p><font size=2>In this equation α, is a real constant and the second term (αu) influences the waves propagation speed. This demonstrates that the speed depends on the state of the wave itself. Further considering the idea that the soliton is a plane wave, the solution (for small amplitudes) is approximately ω=ck-k<sup>3</sup>.</font>"</p>
