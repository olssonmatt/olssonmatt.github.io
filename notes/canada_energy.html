            <li>Key Descriptors<ul>
            <li>Canada, with its large landmass and diversified geography, has substantial renewable resources that can be used to produce energy; these resources include moving water, wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, and ocean energy.<ul>
            <li>Canada is a world leader in renewable resources. Renewable energy sources currently provide about 18.9 per cent of Canada’s total primary energy supply.</li>
            <li>Moving water is the most important renewable energy source in Canada, providing 59.3 per cent of Canada’s electricity generation</li>
            <li>Wind is the second most important renewable energy source in Canada. It accounts for 3.5 per cent of electricity generation in Canada.</li>
            <li>Biomass is the third largest renewable source of Canada’s electricity generation. Its share in Canada’s electricity generation is 1.4 per cent.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Wind and solar photovoltaic energy are the fastest growing sources of electricity in Canada.</em></strong></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What is renewable energy?<ul>
            <li>It is energy that is derived from natural processes that are replenished at a rate that is equal to or faster than the rate at which they are consumer<ul>
            <li>$\frac{\partial E_{replenished}}{\partial t} \geq \frac{\partial E_{consumed}}{\partial t}$</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Solar energy<ul>
            <li>It is energy from the sun in the form of radiated heat and light</li>
            <li>Historically done through passive solar technologies (?)</li>
            <li>Currently, two active solar technologies involve electrical or mechanical or more common<ol>
            <li>Solar 'collectors' or panels are used to heat water or ventilation air</li>
            <li>Solar photovoltaic techonology uses solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity<ul>
            <li>Some PV cells can convert artificial light into electricity</li>
            <li>Wonder if this can leverage street light or what other artificial sources can be taken advantage of</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Potential of solar in costal areas of Canada is low due to cloud coverage and higher in central regions</li>
            <li><strong><em>They estimate half of Canada's residential electricity requiremetn could be met by solar</em></strong><ul>
            <li>An important measurement considering roughly half of Canada's population are in southern Ontario</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Canada has favoured photovoltaic (PV) technology to be a renewable energy source due to the following factors; need to reduce greenhouse gases, deregulation?, and restructing electric power generating companies<ul>
            <li>Primary mandate is to help develop and deploy photocoltaic energy technologies in Canada</li>
            <li>This is done by firstly by accelerating the deployement of solar power in Canada, and secondly by exploiting solar energy's potential nationally and internationally</li>
