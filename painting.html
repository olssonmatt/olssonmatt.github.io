            <h1>determining the authenticity of an unknown painting</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>summary</h2>
                <p>An unknown painting that was traced back to Rembrandt art school belongs to a private collector. A team of researchers had ran neutron autoradiography scans on the painting to excite lead, copper, calcium, iron, and manganese. Using a variety of resources, I was to gather conclusion of whether the painting was legitimate and if it could have been Rembrandts. I also calculated the expected radioactivity of the painting after exposure to the neutrons.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>example</h2>
                <p>A small portion of the paper was taken out to display some of the work I did.</p>
                <br>
                <p> "<font size=2>Before the paper's analysis is discussed, the process of how they did the analyses will be talked about. The team used facilities at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and uses the BER II to carry out Neutron-Autoradiography [8]. Neutron-Autoradiography is a technique that uses the fact that neutrons are not charged and they can penetrate a target a few centimeters deep. Exposing the painting to these neutrons would irradiate the painting [3]. The atomic nuclei in the painting are then brought into an excited state and can emit γ- or β-rays. The half-lives of the elements tell us then what is inside the painting. This would then bring in the need for a detector and this is done by Micro-X-Ray Fluorescence [8]. So now that the process is known, the results can be looked at. For lead (figure 6), there is little lead in the paint itself but rather in the material it is painted on. This is a very interesting note. The artwork was painted on wood, rather than the typical canvas. The artist in this case had covered the wood in a thin layer of lead white. This was done to fill the little gaps in the wood and to get a more flat canvas. Regardless of the application, it is seen that it is present in the paint but at a low degree in the darker areas (which is expected). For iron/manganese (figure 7), there is a strong correlation between the two in the same area. They are in a higher concentration around the outline of the man. In a dark area like that this agrees with the expected result because Umber contains the manganese and the Van Dyke Brown contains iron. They both combine to create that dark, dingy colour but not a solid black around the man. For the copper/calcium (figure 8), there is an interesting pattern that arises. The copper follows the outline of the man like iron and manganese. The copper comes from the blue paint and it can be seen that there is a strong mix of blues, and browns to achieve the colour that Rembrandt did. The calcium, however starts to take the opposite shaping of the outline. Calcium is found in the bone black colour. This means that to differentiate between the darkness of the mixed blues and browns, Rembrandt had to achieve a darker colour that would accentuate the man's body but not make it obvious. The calcium bleeds into other areas as well. Bone black is the lighter of the two blacks and can be used to make grey easier. This is why it is seen on the floor in the grey area. With all of the scans agreeing with the expected elements, it can be used as evidence that the painting of <i>The Reading Hermit</i> is an original. Although it is not a definitive test, it gives evidence of it being authentic [8].</font>"</p>
