                    <p>My progress in data science will hopefully allow me to apply my toolbox of skills to a various amount of projects. I find data analysts to be considered a kind of modern "jack of all trades", meaning their skills can be applied with ease to projects of different subject matter. Some areas I hope to apply this knowledge to would be the esport Valorant, chess, and perhaps some open source data set I find interesting.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>Aside from data science, I hope to be rounding out my self study in mathematics and physics. I plan to do this by making short papers (essentially literary reviews) in a few topics. These would be investaging primes, quantum gravity, and particle physics. They do seem daunting and are at the height of complexity so I expect the papers to be amateurish. Because of this they act as a guide to further my study.</p>
