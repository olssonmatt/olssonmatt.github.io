                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>My undergraduate thesis was titled 'Using Monte Carlo Simulations to Mimic Cosmic Radiation Damage' and was completed under the supervision of Dr. Harroun. Further information on the topic can be available upon request. </p>

                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>When astronauts are sent into space to complete their missions, they face a unique problem. On Earth, the stratosphere and the thermosphere offer protection from harmful radiation (ultraviolet, cosmic background radiation). This thesis seeks to observe and calculate the increased amount of radiation an astronaut would undergo without that protection. Different materials will also be tested to see what said materials would be suited best to protect them. This will be done by Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated particles will mimic radiation produced by the Elekta LINAC IMRT and will be incident on a mouse. Each simulation will consider 8 configurations of the particle phase space.</p>
                    <p>The objects test in between the incident beam and the mouse were water, water at half thickness, polyethylene, and polyethylene at half thickness. The results followed an intuitive order of which materials had the largest Dosage First was water at half thickness having the highest dosage at an average of 5.0x10<sup>-7</sup> Gy. Next came water at 3.5x10<sup>-7</sup> Gy, polyethylene at half thickness with 3.5x10<sup>-7</sup> Gy, and finally polyethylene with 2x10<sup>-7</sup> Gy. However, since the dosages are rather small and generally close in nature the effectiveness will be brought into light. Considerations for future endeavours will be gauging size (computational time & particle count), and effectiveness of the materials.</p>
